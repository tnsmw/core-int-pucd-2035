      <h1>Excerpt from The Fungus that Reduced Humanity to The Last of Us</h1>
      <h3>Kyle Hill, Jun 25 2013</h3>

  <p class="pull-quote">“Pop culture is again in the quickly decaying grasp of a shambling horde. For how many times zombies have appeared, they rarely have a real scientific reason to.”</p>
    </section>
      <section class="article">
        <P>Sometimes it’s a supernatural cause as in <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>. Other times it’s a generic “zombie virus” as in <i>The Walking Dead</i>. In all the attempts to make the dead live again, science usually takes a back seat to the gore–at least until the latest popular iteration of zombies. <i>The Last of Us</i>–a new videogame touted as a masterpiece–has the most scientific explanation for zombies yet, because it uses zombies that <i>actually exist</i>.</P>

<P>In <i>The Last of Us</i>, 60 percent of humanity is wiped out by the genus of parasitic fungus <i>Cordyceps</i>. Out of the 400 species in the genus, all of these parasites make their homes inside the bodies of others—mostly in insects but some even in other fungi. Not all of these parasites are the evil zombie-makers you might think. A few species of <i>Cordyceps</i> have medicinal value. One of these fungi, <i>Cordyceps subsessilis</i>, has been used to derive immunosuppressive drugs used in organ transplants. But some species of <i>Cordyceps</i> are indeed body snatchers–they have been making real zombies for millions of years.</P>

<p>The most cited infestor, <i>Ophiocordyceps unilateralis</i> (previsouly <i>Cordyceps unilateralis</i>), has captured public interest almost as much as zombies have. The fungus famously uses a specific species of ant to complete its life cycle. To live, it must zombify an ant. The consuming fungus forces an ant of the species <i>Camponotus leonardi</i> to get a “death grip” on the underside of a leaf—a position prime for the fungus’ transmission. The poor infected insect–once adorned with a harmless looking spore–then has its tissue slowly eaten and replaced. All that remains of the ant at this point is the exoskeleton, a husk. A deceased ant if there ever was one, save for the spiraling fruiting bodies of the fungus now protruding from the ant’s head and body. These bodies burst forth from the ant, eventually releasing spores ready to begin the cycle anew.</p>

<p>In <i>The Last of Us, Cordyceps</i> adds humans to the list of hosts. The apocalypse starts when the fungus makes a jump from their typical hosts to humans in presumably the same way some diseases like “swine flu” can jump between species. The new, unidentified species of <i>Cordyceps</i> turns humans first into violent “infected” and then into blind “clickers,” complete with fruiting bodies sprouting from their faces. Like traditional zombie canon, a zombie bite is death. However, the inhalation of <i>Cordyceps</i> spores is the un-death sentence.</p>
